# Jonathan Fadera Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

With these points in mind, I am setting myself up for future success by applying the core skills that I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I get to practice my new skills while creating something that I'll be using during my job search.
